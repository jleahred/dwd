* master detail routes 

This is considered good, but it's missing to parse and use the page on route

It would be interested on accept multiple routes to parse here

urlParser : UrlParser.Parser (Int -> a) a
urlParser =
    UrlParser.s baseRoute
        </> UrlParser.s "page"
        </> UrlParser.int


http://localhost:3000/#test_masterdetail/mastdetall/page/22

* master detail
    * next previous buttons
        * on click link to next page configuration on url
* Gen find
